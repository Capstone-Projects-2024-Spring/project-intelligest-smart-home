This application aims to empower users to seamlessly interact with their smart home devices through American Sign Language (ASL) or hand signals. Unlike traditional smart home systems that require speech recognition, IntelliGest will detect common ASL and gestures to control a home. IntelliGest will utilize the open-source Home Assistant software to serve as the foundations for the home assistant. Image recognition will be utilized to detect common ASL words and utilize them to control a smart home. Users set up the device along with a camera in an area of their choosing in order to allow the user to use ASL where they feel comfortable. Using image recognition, the system will then look to recognize any of the known ASL words or gestures and perform actions mapped to them. Users will also have access to a touchscreen display that will be used to display information they ask for as well as provide an intuitive UI and dashboard displaying them with information about their home. Users will also be notified when an action is completed, such as turning a light on or off, and locking a door."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The product will be prototyped on a Raspberry Pi 4 running the Raspberry Pi OS with a Coral USB TPU for machine learning co-processing.
