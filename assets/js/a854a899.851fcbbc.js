This product provides a service to a community that often gets overlooked in the smart home sphere. Using cameras and advanced machine learning technology, IntelliGest will recognize ASL and gestures to control a smart home; something that the current competitors do not provide. When a word or gesture is recognized, MQTT will send a message to Home Assistant to perform an action based on what was asked. Once the action is recognized and received, the user will be notified through one of two ways.
