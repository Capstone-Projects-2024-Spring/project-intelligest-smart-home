This product provides a service to a community that often gets overlooked in the smart home sphere. Using cameras and advanced machine learning technology, IntelliGest will recognize ASL and gestures to control a smart home; something that the current competitors do not provide. When a word or gesture is recognized, MQTT will send a message to Home Assistant to perform an action based on what was asked. Once the action is recognized and received, the user will be notified through one of two ways. They will notice that the dashboard is updated based on the action performed, and they will be notified by the lights slightly dimming for a second to signify their action was recognized and received."]})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.ah)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},3905:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{ah:()=>l});var o=r(67294);function n(e,t,r){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:r,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=r,e}function i(e,t){var r=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(o=o.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),r.push.apply(r,o)}return r}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var r=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?i(Object(r),!0).forEach((function(t){n(e,t,r[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(r)):i(Object(r)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(r,t))}))}return e}function a(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var r,o,n=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var r,o,n={},i=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)r=i[o],t.indexOf(r)>=0||(n[r]=e[r]);return n}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)r=i[o],t.indexOf(r)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,r)&&(n[r]=e[r])}return n}var c=o.createContext({}),l=function(e){var t=o.useContext(c),r=t;return e&&(r="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),r},d={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return o.createElement(o.Fragment,{},t)}},m=o.forwardRef((function(e,t){var r=e.components,n=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,c=e.parentName,m=a(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),h=l(r),u=n,p=h["".concat(c,".").concat(u)]||h[u]||d[u]||i;return r?o.createElement(p,s(s({ref:t},m),{},{components:r})):o.createElement(p,s({ref:t},m))}));m.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
