Light controlling through HA(Home Assistant) and MQTT includes configuring both the HA and the MQTT broker to allow communication and control over lighting devices

---
# To Set up and use the MQTT Light unit in HA for controlling lights

    - Enable the MQTT light unit in HA 
        This part is for controlling lighting features such as brightness, color(RGB/RGBW/RGBWW), and color templerature.
    
    - Define MQTT topics
        Specify MQTT topics for state updates and command controls. Each light or group of lights should have a unique topic for sending commands to control the lights and receiving state updates to know the current state of the lights.
        
    - Use templates for payloads
        Utilize templates to customize the payloads sent to and received from lights. Templates can dynamically generate the payload based on various conditions or inputs, such as the current color or brightness level selected.

    - Configure light details
        State the details of lights in the HA configuration
            1. The payload for the on or off states to turn the lights on or off.
            2. RGB color values for color control
            3. Brightness levels to adjust the light brightness

# To connect light to MQTT and integrate them into HA setup

    - Organize Configuration files
        create or modify external configuration files within HA, specifically 'lights.yaml' for light configurations and 'automations.yaml' for automation rules
    
    - state lights in 'lights.yaml' 
        include necessary details such as name, platform (MQTT), command topic and state topic
    
    - set up MQTT topics
        for each light, set up MQTT topics that control the light's state(on/off, brightness, color, etc.) and topics that receive state updates from the lights. 

    - configure automations in'automations.yaml'
        in the file, create automation rules that link the physical state changes of your lights to MQTT messages. 

    - integrate MQTT Topics 
        ensure the MQTT topics for lights are correctly referenced in both the 'lights.yaml' and 'automations.yaml' files. This allows HA to control the lights and receive updates through MQTT.
    
    - Test setup
        Now, should be able to test for the result. To test setup by controlling lights through HA and checking if the state changes are correctly reflected and synchronized through MQTT
